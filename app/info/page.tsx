            <p className="mb-6">
            Lately, I've been diving deep into the intersection of design and AI—exploring how intelligent tools can enhance creativity, speed up workflows, and shape the future of product development. I'm excited about how AI is reshaping design, and I actively incorporate it into my process to stay ahead.

            I thrive in collaborative environments, whether brainstorming on paper or prototyping in pixels. I adapt easily, believe in lean principles, and love seeing a product through from concept to launch. Above all, I care deeply about crafting experiences that are meaningful, scalable, and beautifully simple.
